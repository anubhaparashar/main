This program will work in the windows XP environment where Access 2003 or 2008 are installed.  First compile AddressBookDataBase.java to make a class file.  Place the created class files in a directory in your computer.  (As the *.class files are included in this zip, compiling the files may not be necessary if your Java runtime is compatible.)  Place the database file in the root of your C: drive.  If you have Access 2008 use the Address.accdb database file.  If you have Access 2003 use the AddressBook.mdb database file.  Navigate to odbcad32.exe (it should be in your Windows directory) and run it (ODBC Data Source Administrator).  Click on the system tab.  Click Add.   Select Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb/accdb) and click finish.  Name the data source and click select and navigate to and select the database (Address.accdb/Address.mdb)  on your c: drive. Run your java file:   

java AddressBookDataBase
